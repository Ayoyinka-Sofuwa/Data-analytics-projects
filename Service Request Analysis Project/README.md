#### INTRODUCTION

This data documents the service request flow within an organisation. Its analysis will determine how much productivity occurs between departments, how quickly requests are attended to, how well they are done and what department receives or sends the most.
Knowledge of this process flow can be used to determine what requests might influence a departments output (considering the time taken for those requests to be attended to) and also how requests and deliveries can be automated between departments within the organisation.
